Uno (Revamped)! There's a visual bug that can occur, will fix it when I get the time.

        - The original Uno project is no longer being updated (and has known bugs)

Mastermind has no known bugs (i.e. please inform of any bugs!)

Minesweeper (Revamped) has no known bugs (i.e. please inform of any bugs!)


Folder assets that should be downloaded with the respective programs:
- "Mastermind.py" with "Mastermind_Assets"
- "Uno.py" with "Uno_Assets"
- "Minesweeper (Revamped).py" with "Minesweeper_Assets"
- "Uno (Revamped).py" with "Revamped Uno_Assets"

In Uno, the size of the window decreases if the screen is too small, though minimal support has been given for smaller screens.
In Uno (Revamped), the "UNO" button is clicked before using the card, not afterwards. There's a side bar on the left that gives details about moves and what is happening.
